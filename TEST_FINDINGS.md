### LIVE-TRANSPORT-001 — closed

```text
FINDING_ID = LIVE-TRANSPORT-001
CASE_ID = CROSS-CASE
DEPLOYED_SOURCE_SHA = 66cdb5b4ddc322a2b1027cab2627426f868027d3
CAPABILITY_FAMILY = C57 CHAT control
RESULT = PASS / CLOSED
OBSERVED = CHAT successfully invoked Live INK named tools through a GitHub-controlled hosted-browser bridge. Capability discovery, context, proposal, approval, execution, Preview, History and Revision all returned structured INK results.
EXPECTED = CHAT can operate Live INK through INK native authorities without mouse emulation or USER relay.
MINIMAL_REPRO = transport-proof-capabilities-003; transport-proof-context-001; transport-proof-closed-loop-002
CLASS = CHAT_EXPOSURE_GAP → REPAIRED
UPSTREAM_DISPOSITION = GitHub Issue #110 closed; bridge runner/workflow installed in INK-Browser-QA.
RERUN_RESULT = PASS
```

### R1-C001-001 — partial

```text
FINDING_ID = R1-C001-001
CASE_ID = C001
DEPLOYED_SOURCE_SHA = 66cdb5b4ddc322a2b1027cab2627426f868027d3
CAPABILITY_FAMILY = C03 C05 C08 C09 C11 C13 C15 C16 C20 C39
RESULT = PARTIAL
OBSERVED = CHAT created native Path + Text, translated both, grouped them, created a Frame, and verified Context/History/Preview. Six scoped History entries were retained. C05/C08/C09/C39 were not proven in this probe.
EXPECTED = C001 probe should establish its distinctive poster-layout capability subset without completing the artwork.
MINIMAL_REPRO = round1-C001-001
CLASS = WORKFLOW_USABILITY_GAP
UPSTREAM_DISPOSITION = Continue Round 1; do not repair until shared gaps are clustered.
RERUN_RESULT = PENDING
```

### R1-MATERIAL-001 — material catalog empty

```text
FINDING_ID = R1-MATERIAL-001
CASE_ID = CROSS-CASE / C001 C002 C008 C013
DEPLOYED_SOURCE_SHA = 66cdb5b4ddc322a2b1027cab2627426f868027d3
CAPABILITY_FAMILY = C39 Material system
RESULT = PARTIAL
OBSERVED = search_ink_library for type=material completed successfully but returned totalMatched=0 in a fresh Live document. path.material.apply.v1 is exposed, but there was no immediately reusable CHAT-visible material entry to apply.
EXPECTED = Mature-work cases mapped to C39 need at least one usable material route: an existing material, a bounded material-creation path, or an explicit case-specific fallback.
MINIMAL_REPRO = round1-library-materials-001
CLASS = CHAT_EXPOSURE_GAP / WORKFLOW_USABILITY_GAP
UPSTREAM_DISPOSITION = Keep open; cluster with all C39 case results after Round 1.
RERUN_RESULT = PENDING
```


### R1-C008-001 — partial

```text
FINDING_ID = R1-C008-001
CASE_ID = C008
DEPLOYED_SOURCE_SHA = 66cdb5b4ddc322a2b1027cab2627426f868027d3
CAPABILITY_FAMILY = C08 C09 C10 C11 C12 C13 C17 C21 C39
RESULT = PARTIAL
OBSERVED = CHAT created vector primitives, executed Boolean union, rotation, radial Repeat and raw SVG import. All mutations produced native History/Revision evidence and final Preview. Align/distribute, smart-guide/snapping and usable material route remain unproven.
EXPECTED = C008 should establish the distinctive geometric-logo vector construction path.
MINIMAL_REPRO = round1-C008-001
CLASS = CHAT_EXPOSURE_GAP / WORKFLOW_USABILITY_GAP
UPSTREAM_DISPOSITION = Continue Round 1; cluster C08/C09/C39 gaps across cases.
RERUN_RESULT = PENDING
```


### R1-C002-001 — partial

```text
FINDING_ID = R1-C002-001
CASE_ID = C002
DEPLOYED_SOURCE_SHA = 66cdb5b4ddc322a2b1027cab2627426f868027d3
CAPABILITY_FAMILY = C02 C18 C19 C20 C22 C39
RESULT = PARTIAL
OBSERVED = CHAT created a Frame and Text, reparented Text, applied Frame layout, registered a Component, edited Text, and rediscovered the Component through Creative Library with a reusable component.instance.create.v1 descriptor. Page mutation, raster/image path, and material path were not established.
EXPECTED = C002 should prove multi-page/layout/component/text/image reuse fundamentals without completing the full deck.
MINIMAL_REPRO = round1-C002-001
CLASS = CHAT_EXPOSURE_GAP / WORKFLOW_USABILITY_GAP
UPSTREAM_DISPOSITION = Continue Round 1; cluster page/raster/material gaps.
RERUN_RESULT = PENDING
```


### R1-C019-001 — text deformation not exposed

```text
FINDING_ID = R1-C019-001
CASE_ID = C019
DEPLOYED_SOURCE_SHA = 66cdb5b4ddc322a2b1027cab2627426f868027d3
CAPABILITY_FAMILY = C10 C14 C20
RESULT = PARTIAL
OBSERVED = CHAT created and edited native Text, created a native vector Path, and transformed the Path. The deployed Public Creative API returned INK_CAPABILITY_NOT_FOUND for text.warp.v1, and no text-warp/deformation route appears in the exposed registry.
EXPECTED = Curved-text case needs an editable warp/deformation authority in addition to ordinary Text and Path operations.
MINIMAL_REPRO = round1-C019-002
CLASS = CHAT_EXPOSURE_GAP
UPSTREAM_DISPOSITION = Keep open and cluster with C14 deformation findings after Round 1.
RERUN_RESULT = PENDING
```


### R1-C007-001 — recipe route incomplete

```text
FINDING_ID = R1-C007-001
CASE_ID = C007
DEPLOYED_SOURCE_SHA = 66cdb5b4ddc322a2b1027cab2627426f868027d3
CAPABILITY_FAMILY = C55 Recipe / automation
RESULT = PARTIAL
OBSERVED = CHAT created a base design, generated a linked grid Repeat and cloned Text successfully. Creative Library recipe search returned zero entries.
EXPECTED = C55 case should eventually prove reusable Recipe/automation semantics, not only repeat/clone primitives.
MINIMAL_REPRO = round1-C007-001
CLASS = CHAT_EXPOSURE_GAP / WORKFLOW_USABILITY_GAP
UPSTREAM_DISPOSITION = Keep open; cluster with Recipe/automation findings after Round 1.
RERUN_RESULT = PENDING
```


### R1-C003-001 — binary reference transport repaired

```text
FINDING_ID = R1-C003-001
CASE_ID = C003
DEPLOYED_SOURCE_SHA = 66cdb5b4ddc322a2b1027cab2627426f868027d3
CAPABILITY_FAMILY = C07 C19 C22 C40 C42
RESULT = PARTIAL
OBSERVED = Initial JSON-only bridge could not satisfy INK's required File/Blob handoff and returned CHAT_REFERENCE_HANDOFF_BINARY_REQUIRED. MR repaired the bridge with bounded qa/fixtures File materialization. Rerun imported the PNG Reference, recorded history/provenance, and completed reference decomposition. Editable Frame/Text structure also executed.
EXPECTED = CHAT can hand a real binary reference into INK and continue with editable structure/reconstruction.
MINIMAL_REPRO = round1-C003-binary-preflight-001 → round1-C003-001
CLASS = CHAT_EXPOSURE_GAP → REPAIRED / WORKFLOW_USABILITY_GAP
UPSTREAM_DISPOSITION = Binary transport repair retained in INK-Browser-QA Live bridge; selection/layout-specific C003 coverage remains for later scan.
RERUN_RESULT = BINARY HANDOFF PASS
```

### R1-TEST-INFRA-001 — decomposition evidence payload oversized

```text
FINDING_ID = R1-TEST-INFRA-001
CASE_ID = CROSS-CASE / C003 C009
DEPLOYED_SOURCE_SHA = 66cdb5b4ddc322a2b1027cab2627426f868027d3
CAPABILITY_FAMILY = C40 C41 C42
RESULT = PARTIAL
OBSERVED = Successful reference decomposition produced a structured Live result of roughly 1.8 MB because thousands of createdRefs were serialized into working/INK_LIVE_CHAT_RESULT.json. The operation completed, but ordinary connector reads become cumbersome.
EXPECTED = Live test transport should retain full artifact evidence while keeping the GitHub SSOT summary compact enough for rapid CHAT scan/review.
MINIMAL_REPRO = round1-C003-001
CLASS = TEST_ENVIRONMENT_LIMIT / WORKFLOW_USABILITY_GAP
UPSTREAM_DISPOSITION = Queue transport-result compaction; do not modify INK product authority for this.
RERUN_RESULT = PENDING
```
